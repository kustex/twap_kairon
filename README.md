# TWAP Order Execution Dashboard

This project is a **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)** trading engine with a built-in **Dash web dashboard** for scheduling and monitoring trades across crypto exchanges (e.g., Bybit, Binance, Bitget).

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 Multi-threaded TWAP execution using background workers
- 🗓️ Schedule jobs with custom trade size, delay, and price limits
- 🔐 Encrypted API key storage using Fernet (AES-128)
- 📊 Real-time Dash dashboard with:
  - Add Exchange panel
  - Submitted Orders table
  - Scheduled Jobs table
  - Active Jobs monitor
- 💾 Uses SQLite for persistent logging of jobs and executions

---

- `Dash`, `dash-bootstrap-components` — frontend UI
- `ccxt` — exchange integration
- `cryptography` — credential encryption
- `sqlite3` — lightweight DB storage
- `threading`, `queue` — job execution engine
